iOS Multitasking
iOS and Apple did a great job designing the multitask function on their devices because it made it super easy and simple to switch between apps. This helps alot when you are working on multiple projects and need to get them done in a timely manner.It is similar to haveing to monitors on your PC, it makes things run more smoothly.
